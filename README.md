# PHPCS Code Review - GitHub Action

[![Project Status: Active – The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active)


A [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) to perform automated [pull request review](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-request-reviews). It is based on https://github.com/Automattic/vip-go-ci/ but can be used for any WordPress or even PHP projects.

The code review is performed using [PHPCS](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer).

Please note that, this action performs pull request review *only*. If you have an existing project, and you want entire project's code to be reviwed, you may need to do it manually.

## Usage

1. Create a `.github/workflows/phpcs.yml` in your GitHub repo, if one doesn't exist already.
2. Add the following code to the `phpcs.yml` file.

```yaml
on: pull_request

name: Inspections
jobs:
  runPHPCSInspection:
    name: Run PHPCS inspection
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      with:
        ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}
    - name: Run PHPCS inspection
      uses: rtCamp/action-phpcs-code-review@v2.0.3
      env:
        GH_BOT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GH_BOT_TOKEN }}
        SKIP_FOLDERS: "tests,.github"
        PHPCS_SNIFFS_EXCLUDE: "WordPress.Files.FileName"
      with:
        args: "WordPress,WordPress-Core,WordPress-Docs"
```

3. Define `GH_BOT_TOKEN` using [GitHub Action's Secret](https://developer.github.com/actions/creating-workflows/storing-secrets). See [GitHub Token Creation](#github-token-creation) section for more details.

Now, next time you create a pull request or commit on an existing pull request, this action will run.

By default, pull request will be reviwed using WordPress coding and documentation standards. You can change the default by passing different [PHPCS Coding Standard(s)](#phpcs-coding-standards) in line `args = ["WordPress-Core,WordPress-Docs"]`.

4. In case you want to skip PHPCS scanning in any pull request, add `[do-not-scan]` in the PR description. You can add it anywhere in the description and it will skip the action run for that pull request.

5. In case you want to skip linting all files on every pull request, set `PHP_LINT` to `false`.

## GitHub Token Creation

You can create [GitHub Token from here](https://github.com/settings/tokens).

It is necessary that you create this token from a [bot user account](https://stackoverflow.com/a/29177936/4108721). Please note that the bot account should have access to the repo in which action is being run, in case it is a private repo. It is compulsory to use a bot account because in GitHub it is forbidden to request changes on your own Pull Request by your own user.
Additional benefit of using a bot account is that in a large team, if you use your human account token, you may get flooded with unncessary Github notifications.

Permissions required for this token differ according to which type of repo this workflow has been setup for.

Repo Type | Permissions Required                                | Screenshots
----------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------
Public    | Under `Repo` section, only `public_repo` permission | [Screenshot Public Repo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4115/54978322-01926100-4fc6-11e9-8da5-1e088fa52b34.png)
Private   | Complete `repo` and `write:discussion` permissions  | [Screenshot Private Repo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4115/54978180-86c94600-4fc5-11e9-846e-7d3fd1dfb7e0.png)

## Environment Variables

Variable       | Default | Possible  Values            | Purpose
---------------|---------|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------
`SKIP_FOLDERS` | -       | `tests`,`tests,.github` (Any other comma seprated top level directories in the repo)     | If any specific folders should be ignored when scanning, then a comma seprated list of values should be added to this env variable.
`PHPCS_SNIFFS_EXCLUDE` | -       | `WordPress.Files.FileName` | Single sniff or comma seprated list of sniffs to be excluded from the phpcs scan.
`PHP_LINT`     | `true`  | `true` or `false`, *case insensitive* (Any unknown value is the same as passing `true`)  | If the default automatic linting of all PHP files should be deactivated, then this env variable should be set to `false`.

## PHPCS Coding Standards

Below is list of PHPCS sniffs available at runtime. You can pass more than one standard at a time by comma separated value.

By default, `WordPress-Core,WordPress-Docs` value is passed.

* MySource
* PEAR
* PHPCompatibility
* PHPCompatibilityParagonieRandomCompat
* PHPCompatibilityParagonieSodiumCompat
* PHPCompatibilityWP
* PSR1
* PSR12
* PSR2
* Squiz
* WordPress _(default)_
* WordPress-Core _(default)_
* WordPress-Docs _(default)_
* WordPress-Extra
* WordPress-VIP
* WordPress-VIP-Go
* WordPressVIPMinimum
* Zend

### Custom Sniffs

If your git repo have a file named `phpcs.xml` in the root of the repository, then that will take precedence. In that case, value passed to args such as `args = ["WordPress,WordPress-Core,WordPress-Docs"]` will be ignored.

If your git repo doesn't have `phpcs.xml` and you do not specify `args` in `main.workflow` PHPCS action, then this actions will fallback to default.

Here is a sample [phpcs.xml](https://github.com/rtCamp/github-actions-wordpress-skeleton/blob/master/phpcs.xml) you can use in case you want to use custom sniffs.

## Limitations

Please note...

1. This action runs only for PRs. It even runs on new commits pushed after a PR is created.
2. This action doesn't run on code in the repository added before this action.
3. This action doesn't run for code committed directly to a branch. We highly recommend that you disable direct commits to your main/master branch.
